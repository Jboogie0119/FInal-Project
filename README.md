# Numpy and panda weather
References-https://www.codecademy.com/article/introduction-to-numpy-and-pandas
This Python script performs a  analysis of weather conditions across different cities. It uses sample data to illustrate key functionalities of the NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries.
"Pandas is a very popular library for working with data (its goal is to be the most powerful and flexible open-source tool, and in our opinion, it has reached that goal). DataFrames are at the center of pandas."
"NumPy is an open-source Python library that facilitates efficient numerical operations on large quantities of data"

# Webscraping and JSON
Uses an API to Obtain JSON Formatted Data 
The script also sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a specified city. It Extracts and Manipulates Values from JSON Formatted Data. After receiving the JSON response from the API, the script extracts the temperature, weather condition, and wind speed. It then prints these values, demonstrating data manipulation.
